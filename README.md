## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Huihui Wu
ðŸ”­ I'm a software engineer at Meta (via HCLTech), working on FBlearner Flow, Meta's internal AI/ML pipeline system. I specialize in AI infrastructure, distributed systems, and full-stack development. Currently, I'm seeking new opportunities where I can leverage my skills to build scalable, high-performance systems.

ðŸ”¹ Experience & Skills
Meta (FBlearner Flow, AI Infra): Designed and optimized Flow lightning runtime, reducing infra overhead 10x. Led standard dashboard development for 30+ teams and helped migrate Flow's key feature for 1000+ teams.

Full Stack Development: Built and deployed an iOS/Android app with Flutter, Firebase, and Node.js. Improved database efficiency by 30% and developed real-time messaging features.

Scalability & Performance: Engineered a high-performance distributed service handling 100k QPS, optimized Redis caching & rate limiting, and ensured system stability during peak loads.

ðŸ”¹ I'm actively looking for new roles in AI infrastructure, backend engineering, or full-stack development. Feel free to connect!
